            <p class="question is-bold">Who is eligible to participate?</p>
            <p class="answer">We are inviting all undergraduate and graduate students to
              participate in our hackathon.
              You don't need any past experience. You don't even need to be a computer science major! Our only
              requirement is that you are at least 18 years old and enrolled in an accredited college or university.

          <div class="faq__single">
            <p class="question is-bold">What will I need to bring? </p>
            <p class="answer">Bring your school ID for registration. You are also responsible
              for bringing any equipment
              for building and demoing your hack: laptop, chargers, phones, etc. You may also want to bring a sleeping
              bag, change of clothes, and toothbrush.

          <div class="faq__single">
            <p class="question is-bold">Do I need to sign up with a team?</p>
            <p class="answer">You don't have to sign up with a team, but it's certainly more
              fun! We allow teams of up
              to four people (they don't have to be from the same school), and while they can be specified on the
              application, you won't officially, create your team until the event. If you don't have a team yet, we'll
              host a social before the hacking begins for you to meet other amazing people.

            <p class="question is-bold">How does travel reimbursement work?</p>
            <p class="answer">At this time, we are unsure about how much travel, reimbursement
              we will be able to offer.
              We currently have bus routes for the following schools: Buffalo, RIT,
              Princeton, Rutgers, and Binghamton. Depending on our budget and interest from other schools, we may be
              able to send out more buses! If your school is not listed, pease message us at info@bigredhacks.com about
              travel reimbursement, and we will see what we can do on a case-by-case basis. In the past, we have capped
              reimbursement at $200 per person. Thank you! </p>
